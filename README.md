# node-chat-app

## About

A chat app I made a few months back studying practical Networking overall. The app makes use of Node.JS modules (express and socket) for the creation of a web server on localhost:(whatever port).

## Features

As of now, there aren't many features, but they are listed as completed or planned below:

### Completed
* Chat moderation made using the "bad-words" NPM package

### Planned
* Assignment of unique colors to each user
* Accessibility of the chat app beyond localhost
* Implementing a part of Discord's features, such as joining servers, channels, and streaming of voice and audio.
* Message formatting using Markdown
